# MultiDBHelper
Dapper-based multi-target .NET Standard library (.NET Standard 2.0/2.1) that can be used in projects with any .NET implementation, like .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, etc., for multi-database access (MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, SQLite).  
Usage is the same as Dapper (see https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper for examples), plus you can select and connect to different databases in a single class.
